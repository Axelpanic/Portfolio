# My Portfolio

## Description

This is my portfolio! I needed a place to showcase my work and my skills, so I built this!
Since I now have a portfolio, I can use it to get a career!
This was not an easy task to build this, I had to find insperation and then figure out how to build it! I learned a few new fance CSS skills along the way!

## Usage
