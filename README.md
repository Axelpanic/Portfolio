# My Portfolio

## Description

This is my portfolio! I needed a place to showcase my work and my skills, so I built this!
Since I now have a portfolio, I can use it to get a career!
This was not an easy task to build this, I had to find insperation and then figure out how to build it! I learned a few new fance CSS skills along the way!

## Usage

This portfolio is for my own personal use! Please do not cut and paste without credit.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

I'd like to thank MDN and github users for insperation, though I eventually learned how to build the portfolio myself they provided a invaluable serivce!
